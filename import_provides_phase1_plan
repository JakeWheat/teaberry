DONE add syntax + parsing tests, remove existing syntax

DONE add let module-name = block ... {} end
  desugaring and see if everything still works, or there is a sensible fix

this is the only external desugaring syntax:
DONE import test-module as X
DONE include from X:
  n1 as n2, ...
end
DONE provide:
  n1 as n2, ...
end
DONE implement the desugaring for all of this
DONE load actual files
  add support for built-ins and file paths
DONE use unique names in desugaring modules
DONE implement the high level desugaring parts
check for import cycles
check diamond imports handled correctly
memoize loading files
document unimplemented bits
check reexporting stuff in various ways works
review: is this a good point to leave it




------------------------------------------------------------------------------
syntax to support, parse tests

provide: * end
provide: a end
provide: a,b end
provide: a as b end
include file("file.tea")
include string-dict
import file("file.tea") as X
import string-dict as X

include from X: * end
include from X: a end
include from X: a,b end
include from X: a as b end
  name1, ...
end

import n1, n2, ... from my-builtin

Unsupported complete list?

provide: type x end
provide: data x end
provide:
  data MyPosn hiding (pos2d, pos3d)
end

the non-file non-built in import sources

provide:
  * hiding (concat-helper)
end
provide from SD: * end
provide:
  module SD
end

provide *
provide-types *
  not sure if these are deprecated

DONE add syntax + parsing tests, remove existing syntax

DONE add let module-name = block ... {} end
  desugaring and see if everything still works, or there is a sensible fix

this is the only external desugaring syntax:
DONE import test-module as X
DONE include from X:
  n1 as n2, ...
end
DONE provide:
  n1 as n2, ...
end
DONE implement the desugaring for all of this
load actual files
  add support for buil-ins and file paths
use unique names in desugaring modules
check for import cycles
check diamond imports handled correctly
implement the high level desugaring parts
review: is this a good point to leave it

syntax to support, parse tests

provide: * end
provide: a end
provide: a,b end
provide: a as b end
include file("file.tea")
include string-dict
import file("file.tea") as X
import string-dict as X

include from X: * end
include from X: a end
include from X: a,b end
include from X: a as b end

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

external desugaring (convert to interpreter syntax)

target:
import file('path') as X
include from X:
  n1 as n2, ...
end
provide:
  n1 as n2, ...
end

import file('path') as X
->
X = module-path-hidden-name
include from X:
  n1 as n2, ...
end
->
n2 = X.n1
# imports and includes need to be ordered

provide: n1 as n2, ... end
-> desugared to a record value
{n2 : n1, ...}
# multiple provides should be combined
# not sure if need this right now
# if there is no provides, then the record value is {}

file is desugared to:

module-file-hidden-name = block:
  ...
  {n1 : n2, ...} # provides
end

---------------------------------------

internal desugaring (macro/ from surface syntax to surface syntax)

provide: * end
->
provide: a,b, ... end # figure out how to find all the values
  # is it very trivial, or just trivial?

provide: a,b end
->
provide: a as a, b as b end

import built-in as X
->
import file("<built-in-path-system-defined>/built-in.tea") as X

include file or built-in
->
import file(xxx) as temp-name
include from temp-name: * end


include from X: * end
->
include from X: all the elements of X listed explicitly


include from X: a,b end
->
include from X: a as a,b as b end

import name1, ... from <some-module>
->
import <some-module> as temp-name
include from temp-name:
  name1, ...
end

add syntax + parsing tests, remove existing syntax

add let module-name = block ... {} end
  desugaring and see if everything still works, or there is a sensible fix

this is the only external desugaring syntax:
import file('path') as X
include from X:
  n1 as n2, ...
end
provide:
  n1 as n2, ...
end
implement the desugaring for all of this
do a quick hack to have a temp 'built in' module which is just available
start with provide and import
then can implement include
get it working
then implement the loading from files
then implement the surface desugaring parts
do multiple provides combining or make it an error




------------------------------------------------------------------------------
syntax to support, parse tests

provide: * end
provide: a end
provide: a,b end
provide: a as b end
include file("file.tea")
include string-dict
import file("file.tea") as X
import string-dict as X

include from X: * end
include from X: a end
include from X: a,b end
include from X: a as b end

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

external desugaring (convert to interpreter syntax)

target:
import file('path') as X
include from X:
  n1 as n2, ...
end
provide:
  n1 as n2, ...
end

import file('path') as X
->
X = module-path-hidden-name
include from X:
  n1 as n2, ...
end
->
n2 = X.n1
# imports and includes need to be ordered

provide: n1 as n2, ... end
-> desugared to a record value
{n2 : n1, ...}
# multiple provides should be combined
# not sure if need this right now
# if there is no provides, then the record value is {}

file is desugared to:

module-file-hidden-name = block:
  ...
  {n1 : n2, ...} # provides
end

---------------------------------------

internal desugaring (macro/ from surface syntax to surface syntax)

provide: * end
->
provide: a,b, ... end # figure out how to find all the values
  # is it very trivial, or just trivial?

provide: a,b end
->
provide: a as a, b as b end

import built-in as X
->
import file("<built-in-path-system-defined>/built-in.tea") as X

include file or built-in
->
import file(xxx) as temp-name
include from temp-name: * end


include from X: * end
->
include from X: all the elements of X listed explicitly


include from X: a,b end
->
include from X: a as a,b as b end

import name1, ... from <some-module>
->
import <some-module> as temp-name
include from temp-name:
  name1, ...
end

importing from files process
  files are always relative to the module file
  built-ins are in a system dir

start with the parsed module
desugar each built-in to a file
each file, load it and parse it
repeat
while doing this, create a list of filepath, parsed module pairs
reverse this list at the end, then it can be concatenated and desugared
while recursing: if a module is seen a second time, it should appear the
  second time and be removed from the first time it is seen
how to detect cycles nicely?

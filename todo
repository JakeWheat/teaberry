implement a simple store without garbage collection/ implement
variables
use these to implement mutual recursion under the covers
make definitions unordered at the top level
  an temporary option is to not allow mutual recursion, but
  reorder the defintions as a desugaring step
implement scripts in files + import
add algebraic data types, recursive data types
start trying to implement some scripts


separately: start doing typed language experiments

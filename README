A learning project to implement a dialect of Pyret.

Goal is to implement a dialect of Pyret in Haskell, with a high level
interpreter, to learn how to implement functional programming + a
basic type system.

Not ready for human consumption yet, see the examples dir for
progress:

https://github.com/JakeWheat/teaberry/tree/master/examples/tests/fulltests

# sketch of early approximate target

mostly pyret syntax to start with
strict/eager
basic functional programming: functions as values + closures
algebraic data types + pattern binding
typed only, with inference
parametric polymorphism
type classes
non whitespace significant (except maybe copying some of pyret, but
  not indentation significant)
no purity tracking in the type system
  (to be reviewed)
exceptions
garbage collection
resource management
control flow: break, continue, goto ?
no implicit casting
no pragmas, javadoc in comment syntax
good error messages
extensible records

# sketch of possible roadmap

This list mostly uses Pyret terminology for the things in Pyret.

## Completed (no rigorous testing or completeness checks yet)

temp command line interface

lambda values, app
closures
letrec

tuples
records
vars
lists
algebraic data types
recursive data types (cheating slightly without types)
pattern binding in let
cases
references (mutable fields)

check, where

shadow (syntax only, shadowing not detected)

## planned

import

contracts and annotations

critical whitespace issues
  1. no space between expr and () in app
  2. no multiple statements without newline

extended pattern binding

types
  needs a todo list
  algebraic data types
    field access in a case
  recursive functions
  recursive data types
  type classes
  extensible records
  ...

type infererence

## smaller planned items

check additional features:
  is-not
  is%
  is-not%
  satisfies
  violates
  raises
  raises-other-than
  raises-satisfies
  raises-violates

shadow (actually does something)

user constructors

lambda shorthand
for loops
curried application
chaining application
block shorthands
non blocky blocks

pattern binding in lambda, functions arguments
record binding

... and variations (like with a message)

doc strings

type and new type

improved set of builtin/basic types

program output fixed to match pyret

fixity handling

source location information available to code
  (__FILE__, etc.)

spy statement

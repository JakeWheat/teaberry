  module a is:

   provide: f end

   fun f(x):
     x + 1
   end

  module b is:

   import a as a

   check:
     a.f(2) is 3
   end

the code represents how the system can desugar this to something
simple where each module with imports and provides can be desugared
very easily and locally, then you run the whole program just by
concatenating the modules in the right order
